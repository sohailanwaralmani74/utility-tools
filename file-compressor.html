  <h2>GZIP Compression Online</h2>
  <p>GZIP is ideal for compressing text-based files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our tool lets you compress files into .gz format in just a click, perfect for web developers looking to optimize site speed. Smaller files mean faster load times and better SEO performance.</p>

  <h3>Create GZIP Files Effortlessly</h3>
  <p>Select your file and convert it to GZIP (.gz) with one click. This format is widely used in server configurations and is ideal for reducing the size of website assets. Enjoy lightning-fast compression with high efficiency and low CPU overhead.</p>

  <h2>7z Compression for Maximum Efficiency</h2>
  <p>Our File Compressor supports 7z format, which uses advanced LZMA and LZMA2 algorithms for exceptional compression ratios. If you’re handling large files or directories, 7z is the ideal choice. The format also supports strong AES-256 encryption for added security.</p>

  <h3>Compress Files into 7z Securely</h3>
  <p>Drag and drop files into our tool and receive a compressed 7z archive in moments. This format is perfect for large-scale file transfers, backups, and secure archiving thanks to its high compression rate and optional password protection.</p>

  <h2>Create TAR Archives Online</h2>
  <p>Compress files into a TAR archive to preserve file structure and metadata. This format is widely used in Unix-based systems and scripting workflows. TAR bundles multiple files together without compressing them, and can then be compressed with GZIP or BZIP2.</p>

  <h3>Build TAR Files for Linux and Unix</h3>
  <p>Use our File Compressor to create TAR archives on the fly. This is especially useful for packaging source code, logs, or configuration files that need to maintain original structure during transfer or deployment.</p>
